MERN STACK 
The objective of this project is to develop a fully functional Clothing E-commerce
Platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The
platform enables users to browse, search, and purchase clothing products. Admins can
manage the product catalog and orders. This project simulates a real-world e-commerce
workflow including user authentication, cart management, and payment simulation.
